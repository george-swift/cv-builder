### Objectives:
- Building a simple React application
- Using React Hooks to manage state logic
- Sharing state and props with React components
- Using React Router to manage a Single Page Application (SPA)
- Functional programming
- Meeting model client requirements

## Features
CV Builder is a single page application with three routes: `About`, `Editor` and `Preview`. The `About` page provides
information about the app. Basically, users fill in personal information and professional details and CV Builder generates a template from these details. On clicking `Get started`, users are routed to the `Editor` page. This page contains a form with the following sections:
`Personal Information`, `Education`, and `Experience`. The last two fields have two buttons `Add new (SECTION NAME)` and `Delete (SECTION NAME)` for adding multiple educational details or work experiences. At the bottom of the form, there is a button to `Preview template` which links a user to a preview of their details so far, and a `Reset all fields` button to clear all input in the editor.
The `Preview` page displays all information from the `Editor`. The page has a button at the bottom of the page `Edit Template` which allows users to edit desired details. The application is hosted on [Netlify](https://minimalist-cv-builder.netlify.app/).
